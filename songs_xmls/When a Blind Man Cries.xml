<verse number="1">If you′re leaving close the door.
I′m not expecting people anymore.
Hear me grieving, I′m lying on the floor.
Whether I′m drunk or dead I really ain′t too sure.
</verse>
<chorus number="1">I′m a blind man, I′m a blind man
And my world is pale.
When a blind man cries,
Lord, you know there aint no sadder tale.
</chorus>
<verse number="2">Had a friend once in a room,
Had a good time but it ended much too soon.
In a cold month in that room
We found a reason for the things we had to do.
</verse>
<chorus number="2">I′m a blind man, I′m a blind man,
Now my room is cold.
When a blind man cries,
Lord, you know he feels it from his soul.
</chorus>
