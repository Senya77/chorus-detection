<verse number="1">Hey, I′m feeling tired
My time, is gone today
You flirt with suicide
Sometimes, that′s ok
Hear what others say
I′m here, standing hollow
Falling away from me
Falling away from me
</verse>
<verse number="2">Day, is here fading
That′s when, I would say
I flirt with suicide
Sometimes kill the pain
I can always say
′it′s gonna be better tomorrow′
Falling away from me
Falling away from me
</verse>
<chorus number="1">Beating me down
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground
Screaming some sound
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground
</chorus>
<verse number="3">(falling away from me)
It′s spinning round and round
(falling away from me)
It′s lost and can′t be found
(falling away from me)
It′s spinning round and round
(falling away from me)
So down
</verse>
<chorus number="2">Beating me down beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground
Screaming some sound
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground
</chorus>
<verse number="4">Pressing me, they won′t go away
So I pray, go away
It′s falling away from me
</verse>
<chorus number="3">Beating me down
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground
Screaming some sound
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground
</chorus>
