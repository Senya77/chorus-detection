<verse number="1">Keep holding on
When my brain′s tickin′ like a bomb
Guess the black thoughts have come
Again to get me
Sweet bitter words
Unlike nothing I have heard
Sing along mocking bird
You don′t affect me
That′s right
Deliverance of my heart
Be straight
Be deliberate
</verse>
<chorus number="1">Wait
I′m coming undone
Unlaced
I′m coming undone
Too late
I′m coming undone
What looks so strong
So delicate
Wait
I′m starting to suffocate
And soon I anticipate
I′m coming undone
What looks so strong
So delicate
</chorus>
<verse number="2">Choke choke again
I thought my demons were my friends
Getting me in the end
They′re out to get me
Since I was young
I′ve tasted sorrow on my tongue
And this sweet chugga gun
Does not protect me
That′s right
Trigger between my eyes
Please strike
Make it quick now
</verse>
<verse number="3">I′m trying to hold it together
Head is lighter than a feather
Looks like i′m not getting better
Not getting better
</verse>
<chorus number="2">Wait
I′m coming undone
Unlaced
I′m coming undone
Too late
I′m coming undone
What looks so strong
So delicate
Wait
I′m starting to suffocate
And soon I anticipate
I′m coming undone
What looks so strong
So delicate
</chorus>
