<verse number="1">Words like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Cant you understand
Oh my little girl
</verse>
<chorus number="1">All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
</chorus>
<verse number="2">Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable
</verse>
<chorus number="2">All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
</chorus>
</song>
