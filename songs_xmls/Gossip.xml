<verse number="1">Welcome to the city of lies
Where everything's got a price
It's gonna be your new favorite place
You can be a movie star
And get everything you want
Just put some plastic on your face
This place is a circus, you just see the
surface
They cover shit under the rug
You can't see they're faking, they'll never
be naked
Just fill your drink with tonic gin, this is the
American dream, so
</verse>
<chorus number="1">So sip the gossip, drink 'til you choke
Sip the gossip, burn down your throat
You're not iconic, you are just like them all
Don't act like you don't know, so
</chorus>
<chorus number="2">So sip the gossip, drink 'til you choke
Sip the gossip, burn down your throat
You're not iconic, you are just like them all
Don't act like you don't know, oh
</chorus>
<verse number="2">Keep drinking and acting cool
Don't care if your day is blue
Nobody loves a gloomy face, just
Take your pills and dance all night
Don't think at all, that's the advice
So c'mon, let's try, it's just a taste
This place is a circus, you just see the
surface
They cover shit under the rug
You can't see they're faking, they'll never
be naked
Just fill your drink with tonic gin, this is the
American dream, so
</verse>
<chorus number="3">So sip the gossip, drink 'til you choke
Sip the gossip, burn down your throat
You're not iconic, you are just like them all
Don't act like you don't know, so
</chorus>
<chorus number="4">So sip the gossip, drink 'til you choke
Sip the gossip, burn down your throat
You're not iconic, you are just like them all
Don't act like you don't know, oh
</chorus>
<chorus number="5">So sip the gossip, drink 'til you choke
Sip the gossip, burn down your throat
You're not iconic, you are just like them all
Don't act like you don't know, oh
</chorus>
