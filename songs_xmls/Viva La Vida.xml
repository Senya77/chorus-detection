<verse number="1">I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sweep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
</verse>
<verse number="2">I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy′s eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!
</verse>
<verse number="3">One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
</verse>
<chorus number="1">I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can not explain
Once you know there was never,
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world
</chorus>
<verse number="4">It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in.
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn′t believe what I′d become
</verse>
<verse number="5">Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king
</verse>
<chorus number="2">I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can not explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
</chorus>
<chorus number="3">I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can not explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
</chorus>
