<verse number="1">It′s been said and done, every beautiful thoughts been
already sung and I guess right now, here′s another one
So your melody will play on and on with the best of ′em
You are beautiful like a dream come alive, incredible
A sinful miracle, lyrical. You saved my life again and I
want you to know
</verse>

And I keep hittin′ repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hittin′ repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat
</chorus>
<verse number="2">Constantly, boy, you played through my mind like a symphony.
There′s no way to describe what you do to me.
You just do to me, what you do and it feels like I′ve been
rescued, I′ve been set free
I am hypnotized by your destiny
You are magical, lyrical, beautiful. And you are
And I want you to know, baby
</verse>

Music to my heart, that′s what you are.
A song that goes on and on
</verse>

And I keep hittin′ repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat
