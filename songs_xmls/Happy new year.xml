<verse number="1">No more champagne
And the fireworks are through
Here we are, me and you
Feeling lost and feeling blue
It′s the end of the party
And the morning seems so grey
So unlike yesterday
Now′s the time for us to say...
</verse>
<chorus number="1">Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don′t we might as well lay down and die
You and I
</chorus>
<verse number="2">Sometimes I see
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
Oh yes, man is a fool
And he thinks he′ll be okay
Dragging on, feet of clay
Never knowing he′s astray
Keeps on going anyway...
</verse>
<chorus number="2">Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don′t we might as well lay down and die
You and I
</chorus>
<verse number="3">Seems to me now
That the dreams we had before
Are all dead, nothing more
