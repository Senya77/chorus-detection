<verse number="1">You're welcome to my world, dark side of the universe
I'll take you for a spin,
the mayhem begins
The media mouth is feeding
and chemical youth that's screaming
The circus starts to roll, there's no turning back
</verse>
<chorus number="1">You think it's right, you made your mind
I've seen so many cross that line
I've seen them come, I've seen them go,
times will never change
It's the same old song - The same old song
That's playing again - The same old song
</chorus>
<verse number="2">Your soul is burning bright, high hopes of future in sight
Beyond the horizon lays a world that's so black
They'll try to shape your mind
and make you walk the line
Don't let them steal your dreams,
it's all that you've got
</verse>
<chorus number="2">You start to doubt, you changed your mind
I've seen so many cross that line
I've seen them come, I've seen them go,
times will never change
It's the same old song - The same old song
That's playing again - The same old song
</chorus>
<verse number="3">Don't wanna hear it no more
Time to do this, time to do that
I've got an offer you can't refuse it
Just stick with me and I'll push you all the way to the stars
I can't take it no more - The same old song
It's playing again - The same old song
Don't wanna hear it no more - The same old song
It's playing again and again and again - The same old song
</verse>
