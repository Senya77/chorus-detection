<verse number="1">City's breaking down on a camel's back.
They just have to go 'cos they don't hold
back
So all you fill the streets it's appealing to
see
You won't get out the country,
'Cos you're bad and free
You've got a new horizon
It's ephemeral style.
A melancholy town where we never smile.
And all I wanna hear is the message
beep.
My dreams, they've got to kiss,
Because I don't get sleep, no..
</verse>
<chorus number="1">Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love has freely
Turned forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?
</chorus>
<verse number="2">Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats,
Lining them up-a like ass cracks,
Ladies, homies, at the track
It's my chocolate attack.
Shit, I'm stepping in the heart of this here
Care bear bumping in the heart of this
here
Watch me as I gravitate
Hahahahahahaa.
Yo, we gonna go ghost town,
This motown,
With yo sound
You in the blink
You gonna bite the dust
Can't fight with us
With yo sound
You kill the INC.
So dont stop, get it, get it
Until you're cheddar header.
Yo, watch the way I navigate
</verse>
<chorus number="2">Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love has freely
Turned forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?
</chorus>
<verse number="3">Don't stop, get it, get it
We are your captains in it
Steady,
Watch me navigate,
Ahahahahahhaa.
Don't stop, get it, get it
We are your captains in it
Steady, watch me navigate
</verse>
