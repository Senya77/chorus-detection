<verse number="1">If you were the Mona Lisa
You′d be hanging in the Louvre
Everyone would come to see you
You′d be impossible to move
It seems to me is what you are
A rare and priceless work of art
Stay behind your velvet rope
But I will not renounce all hope
</verse>
<chorus number="1">And I′m right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of a masterpiece
And I can′t tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with the masterpiece
Cause after all
Nothing′s indestructible
</chorus>
<verse number="2">From the moment I first saw you
All the darkness turned to light
An impressionistic painting
Tiny particles of light
It seem to me is what you′re like
The look but please don′t touch me type
And honestly it can′t be fun
To always be the chosen one
</verse>
<chorus number="2">And I′m right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of a masterpiece
And I can′t tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece
Cause after all
Nothing′s indestructible
Nothing′s indestructible
Nothing′s indestructible
Nothing′s indestructible
</chorus>
<chorus number="3">And I′m right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of a masterpiece
And I can′t tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece
</chorus>
<chorus number="4">And I′m right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of a masterpiece
And I can′t tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece
Cause after all
Nothing′s indestructible
Cause after all
Nothing′s indestructible
</chorus>
