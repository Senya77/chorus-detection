<chorus number="1">Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot,
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot,
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
</chorus>
<verse number="1">My horse, is a shackled old man
His, his remorse
Was that he couldn′t survey
The skies, right before
Right before, they went grey
My horse, and my remorse
Flying over a great bay
</verse>
<chorus number="2">Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot,
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot,
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
</chorus>
<verse number="2">My source, is the source of all creation
Her, discourse, is that we all don′t survey
The skies, right before
Right before, they go grey
My source and my remorse
Flying over a great bay
</verse>
<chorus number="3">Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot,
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot,
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
</chorus>
<chorus number="4">Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot,
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot,
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
