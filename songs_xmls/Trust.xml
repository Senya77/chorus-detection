<verse number="1">Lost in a dream
Nothing′s what it seems
Searching my head
For the words that you said
</verse>
<verse number="2">Tears filled my eyes
As we said our last goodbyes
This sad scene replays
Of you walking away
</verse>
<chorus number="1">My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
</chorus>
<verse number="3">Time and again
She repeats, Let′s be friends.
I smile and say, Yes.
Another truth bends,
I must confess
</verse>
<verse number="4">I try to let go, but I know
We′ll never end ′til we′re dust
We lied to each other again
But I wish I could trust
</verse>
<chorus number="2">My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
</chorus>
<chorus number="3">God, help me please, on my knees
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
Now there′s nothing we trust
</chorus>
<verse number="5">How could this be happening to me
I′m lying when I say, Trust me.
I can′t believe this is true.
Trust hurts.
Why does trust equal suffering
Absolutely nothing we trust.
</verse>
