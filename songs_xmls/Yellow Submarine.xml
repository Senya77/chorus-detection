<verse number="1">In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
</verse>
<verse number="2">So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine
</verse>
<chorus number="1">We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
</chorus>
<verse number="3">And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
</verse>
<chorus number="2">We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
</chorus>
<verse number="4">As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine
</verse>
<chorus number="3">We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
</chorus>
<chorus number="4">We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
</chorus>
