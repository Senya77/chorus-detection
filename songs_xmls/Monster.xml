<verse number="1">The secret side of me
I never let you see
I keep it caged, but I can't control it
So stay away from me
The beast is ugly
I feel the rage, and I just can't hold it
It's scratching on the walls
In the closet, in the halls
It comes awake, and I can't control it
Hiding under the bed
In my body, in my head
Why won't somebody come and save me from this?
Make it end
</verse>
<chorus number="1">I feel it deep within
It's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I hate what I've become
The nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
</chorus>
<verse number="2">My secret side I keep
Hid under lock and key
I keep it caged, but I can't control it
'Cause if I let him out
He'll tear me up, break me down
Why won't somebody come and save me from this?
Make it end
</verse>
<chorus number="2">I feel it deep within
It's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I hate what I've become
The nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I feel it deep within
It's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
</chorus>
<verse number="3">It's hiding in the dark
Its teeth are razor-sharp
There's no escape for me, it wants my soul, it wants my heart
No one can hear me scream
Maybe it's just a dream
Maybe it's inside of me
Stop this monster
</verse>
<chorus number="3">I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I hate what I've become
The nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I feel it deep within
It's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I’m gonna lose control
It’s something radical
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
</chorus>
