<verse number="1">I have a problem that I cannot explain,
I have no reason why it should′ve been so plain,
Have no questions but I sure have excuse,
I lack the reason why I should be so confused.
</verse>
<chorus number="1">I know, how I feel when I′m around you,
I don′t know, how I feel when I′m around you,
Around you.
</chorus>
<verse number="2">Left a message but it ain′t a bit of use,
I have some pictures, the wild might be the deuce,
Today you saw, you saw me, you explained,
Playin the show and running down the plane.
</verse>
<chorus number="2">I know, how I feel when I′m around you,
I don′t know, how I feel when I′m around you,
I know, how I feel when I′m around you,
I don′t know, how I feel when I′m around you,
Around you,
</chorus>
<chorus number="3">I know, how I feel when I′m around you,
I don′t know, how I feel when I′m around you,
I know, how I feel when I′m around you,
I don′t know, how I feel when I′m around you,
Around you, Around you, Around you...
