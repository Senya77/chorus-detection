<verse number="1">I have a problem that I can not explain,
I have no reason why it should have been
so plain,
Have no questions but I sure have
excuse,
I lack the reason why I should be so
confused
</verse>
<chorus number="1">I know,how I feel when I'm around you,
I don't know,how I feel when I'm around
you...
Around you...
</chorus>
<verse number="2">Left a message but it ain't a bit of use,
I have some pictures the wild might be the
deuce.
Today you called, you saw me,you
explained,
Playing the show and running down the
plane.
</verse>
<chorus number="2">I know,how I feel when I'm around you,
I don't know,how I feel when I'm around
you...
I,I know,how I feel when I'm around you
I don't know how I feel when I'm around
you...
Around you...
</chorus>
<chorus number="3">I,I know,how I feel when I'm around you,
I don't know,how I feel when I'm around
you
I,I know,how I feel when I'm around you
I don't know how I feel when I'm around
you...
