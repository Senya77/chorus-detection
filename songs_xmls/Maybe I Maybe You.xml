<verse number="1">Maybe I, maybe you
Can make a change to the world
We′re reaching out for a soul
That′s kind of lost in the dark
</verse>
<verse number="2">Maybe I, maybe you
Can find the key to the stars
To catch the spirit of hope
To save one hopeless heart
</verse>
<chorus number="1">You look up to the sky
With all those questions in mind
All you need is to hear
The voice of your heart
In a world full of pain
Someone′s calling your name
Why don′t we make if true
Maybe I, maybe you
</chorus>
<verse number="3">Maybe I, maybe you
Are just dreaming sometimes
But the world would be cold
Without dreamers Ilke you
</verse>
<verse number="4">Maybe I, maybe you
Aree just soldiers of love
Born to carry the flame
Bringin′ light to the dark
</verse>
<chorus number="2">You look up to the sky
With all those questions in mind
All you need is to hear
The voice of your heart
In a world full of pain
Someone′s calling your name
Why don′t we make if true
Maybe I, maybe you
</chorus>
