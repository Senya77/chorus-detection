<verse number="1">You′re just too good to be true
I can′t take my eyes off of you
You′d be like heaven to touch
Oh, I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I′m alive
You′re just too good to be true
I can′t take my eyes off of you
</verse>
<chorus number="1">I love you baby, and if it′s quite all right
I need you baby, you warm a lonely night
I love you baby. Trust in me when I say
I love you baby, don′t let me down I pray
I love you baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, baby
let me love you
</chorus>

You′re just too good to be true
I can′t take my eyes off of you
