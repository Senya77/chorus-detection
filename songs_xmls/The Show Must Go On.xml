<verse number="1">Empty spaces - what are we living for
Abandoned places - I guess we know the score
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for
</verse>
<verse number="2">Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore
</verse>
<chorus number="1">The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
</chorus>
<verse number="3">Whatever happens, I′ll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for
</verse>
<verse number="4">I guess I′m learning, I must be warmer now
I′ll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I′m aching to be free
</verse>
<chorus number="2">The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
</chorus>
<verse number="5">My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly - my friends
</verse>
<chorus number="3">The show must go on
The show must go on
I′ll face it with a grin
I′m never giving in
On - with the show -
</chorus>
<verse number="6">I′ll drop the bill, I′ll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the -
On with the show -
The show must go on
</verse>
</song>
