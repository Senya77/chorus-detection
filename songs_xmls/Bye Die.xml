<verse number="1">Tell me
What do you see when you see yourself
I don’t really get it
How do you make it through the day without killing yourself?
</verse>
<chorus number="1">Bye, bye,
Why don’t you go and
Die, die,
I’ll fuck you up
You want me on my knees, but I’m not going down
Bye, bye,
Leave me alone or
Die, die,
It is your choice
No time for games, so just leave me fuck alone!
</chorus>
<verse number="2">Do you know, you’re all the same
Got to play this stupid game
You’re getting on my nerves, so just stay the fuck away
Who died and made you God
This time you’ve gone too far
I think it’s time for you to understand – this is war!
</verse>
<verse number="2">There’s nothing to see here,
I don’t wanna be here,
Get me out of here right now
I cannot sit around and wait for you to drive me insane
</verse>
<chorus number="2">Bye, bye,
Why don’t you go and
Die, die,
I’ll fuck you up
You want me on my knees, but I’m not going down
Bye, bye,
Leave me alone or
Die, die,
It is your choice
No time for games, so just leave me fuck alone!
</chorus>
<verse number="3">Shut up…
So you think I’m unreasonable
Do you really think I am a toy that you can kick around?
Don’t come here, you’re a waste of time
Some people never know, when it’s time to back away
It will come back at you and slap you in the face
</verse>
<verse number="4">There’s nothing to see here,
I don’t wanna be here,
Get me out of here right now
I cannot sit around and wait for you to drive me insane
</verse>
<verse number="5">I don’t have patience so what are you after
Do you want me to snap right now?
Some things will never ever change,
Like you and your ugly face
</verse>
<chorus number="3">Bye, bye,
Why don’t you go and
Die, die,
I’ll fuck you up
You want me on my knees, but I’m not going down
Bye, bye,
Leave me alone or
Die, die,
It is your choice
No time for games, so just leave me fuck alone!
</chorus>
<chorus number="4">Bye, bye, it is your choice
Die, die, I’ll fuck you up
Bye, bye, why don’t you go and
Die, die, leave me alone!
