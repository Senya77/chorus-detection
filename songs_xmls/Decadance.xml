<verse number="1">Say, yes they know that you fought yourself another time
Don′t they know that you′re full of pain already?
Yes they know that you′ve hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn′t easy, is it?
Yes they know that you′ve hurt yourself another time
Don′t they know that you′re full of pain already?
Yes they know that you′ve hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn′t easy, is it?
</verse>
<chorus number="1">Then you slowly recall all your mind
Why, your soul′s gone cold, and all hope has run dry
Dead inside
Never enough to forget that you′re one of the lonely
Slowly recall all your mind
</chorus>
<verse number="2">Say, yes they know that you′ve hurt yourself another time
Don′t they know that you′re full of pain already?
Yes they know that you′ve hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn′t easy, is it?
Yes they know that you′ve hurt yourself another time
Don′t they know that you′re full of pain already?
Yes they know that you′ve hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn′t easy...
</verse>
<chorus number="2">Then you slowly recall all your mind
Why, your soul′s gone cold, and all hope has run dry
Dead inside
Never enough to forget that you′re one of the lonely
Slowly recall all your mind
</chorus>
<verse number="3">If I scare you now
Don′t run from me
I′ve been hiding my pain, you see
Said if I scare you now
Don′t run from me
I′ve been hiding my pain, you see
</verse>
<chorus number="3">Slowly recall all your mind
Why, your soul′s gone cold, and all hope has run dry
Dead inside
Never enough to forget that you′re one of the lonely
Slowly recall all your mind
Slowly recall all your mind
</chorus>
<verse number="4">Say, yes they know that you′ve hurt yourself another time
Don′t they know that you′re full of pain already?
Yes they know that you′ve hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn′t easy, is it?
