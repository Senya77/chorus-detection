<verse number="1">End of passion play, crumbling away
I′m your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death’s construction
</verse>
<chorus number="1">Taste me you will see
more is all you need
you′re dedicated to
how I′m killing you
Come crawling faster
obey your Master
your life burns faster
obey your Master
Master
Master of Puppets I′m pulling your strings
twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can′t see a thing
Just call my name, ′cause I′ll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name, ′cause I′ll hear you scream
Master
Master
</chorus>
<verse number="2">Needlework the way, never you betray
life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
chop your breakfast on a mirror
</verse>
<chorus number="2">Taste me you will see
more is all you need
you′re dedicated to
how I′m killing you
Come crawling faster
obey your Master
your life burns faster
obey your Master
Master
Master of Puppets I′m pulling your strings
twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can′t see a thing
Just call my name, ′cause I′ll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name, ′cause I′ll hear you scream
Master
Master
</chorus>
<verse number="3">Master, Master, Where′s the dreams that I′ve been after
Master, Master, You promised only lies
Laughter, Laughter, All I hear and see is laughter
Laughter, Laughter, laughing at my cries
</verse>
<verse number="4">Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
just a rhyme without a reason
Neverending maze, drift on numbered days
now your life is out of season
</verse>
<chorus number="3">I will occupy
I will help You die
I will Run Through You
Now I Rule You Too
Come crawling faster
obey your Master
your life burns faster
obey your Master
Master
Master of Puppets I′m pulling your strings
twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can′t see a thing
Just call my name, ′cause I′ll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name, ′cause I′ll hear you scream
Master
Master
</chorus>
