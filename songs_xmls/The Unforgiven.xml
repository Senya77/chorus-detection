<verse number="1">New blood joins this earth
And quikly hes subdued
Through constant pain disgrace
The young boy learns their rules
</verse>
<verse number="2">With time the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on hes known
A vow unto his own
That never from this day
His will theyll take away
</verse>
<chorus number="1">What Ive felt
What Ive known
Never shined through in what Ive shown
Never be
Never see
Wont see what might have been
</chorus>
<chorus number="2">What Ive felt
What Ive known
Never shined through in what Ive shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub the unforgiven
</chorus>
<verse number="3">They dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same
Hes battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares
To die regretfully
That old man here is me
</verse>
<chorus number="3">What Ive felt
What Ive known
Never shined through in what Ive shown
Never be
Never see
Wont see what might have been
</chorus>
<chorus number="4">What Ive felt
What Ive known
Never shined through in what Ive shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub the unforgiven
You labeled me
Ill label you
So I dub the unforgiven
</chorus>
