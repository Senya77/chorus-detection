<verse number="1">She′s got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I′d stare too long
I′d probably break down and cry
</verse>
<chorus number="1">Sweet child o′ mine
Sweet love of mine
</chorus>
<verse number="2">She′s got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I′d hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by
</verse>
<chorus number="2">Sweet child o′ mine
Sweet love of mine
</chorus>
<verse number="3">Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Sweet child o′ mine
</verse>
