<verse number="1">I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
</verse>
<verse number="2">The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers
The futureâ€²s in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change
</verse>
<chorus number="1">Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change
</chorus>
<verse number="3">Walking down the street
Distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
</verse>
<chorus number="2">Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me
</chorus>
<chorus number="3">Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change
</chorus>
<verse number="4">The wind of change blows straight
Into the face of time
Like a stormwind that will ring
The freedom bell for peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say
</verse>
<chorus number="4">Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me
</chorus>
<chorus number="5">Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
</chorus>
