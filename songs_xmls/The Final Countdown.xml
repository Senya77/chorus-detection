<verse number="1">We′re leaving together,
But still it′s farewell
And maybe we′ll come back,
To earth, who can tell
I guess there is no one to blame
We′re leaving ground (leaving ground)
Will things ever be the same again
</verse>
<chorus number="1">It's the final countdown
The final countdown
</chorus>
<verse number="2">We′re heading for Venus
And still we stand tall
Cause maybe they′ve seen us
And welcome us all
With so many light years to go
And things to be found (to be found)
I′m sure that we′ll all miss her so.
</verse>
<chorus number="2">It's the final countdown
The final countdown
