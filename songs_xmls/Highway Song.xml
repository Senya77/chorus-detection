<verse number="1">I need, I feel, a love,
You love to love the fear,
I never want to be alone,
I′ve forgotten to.
The road keeps moving clouds,
The clouds become unreal,
I guess I′ll always be at home,
</verse>
<chorus number="1">Do you want me to try,
Directing your night.
</chorus>
<verse number="2">An exit lights the sky,
The sky becoms complete,
Traveling hearts divine the throne,
I′ve forgotten to.
Friction, lines, bumps,
The highway song complete,
the signs are all tuning right,
</verse>
<chorus number="2">Do you want me to try,
Directing your night,
Want me to try,
Directing your light.
</chorus>
<verse number="3">The purest forms of life,
Our days are never coming back,
The cannons of our time,
Our days are never coming back,
The purest forms of life,
Our days are never coming back,
The cannons of our time,
</verse>
<verse number="4">Our days are never ever coming back.
Our days are never coming back,
Our days are never coming back,
Our days are never coming back.
</verse>
