<verse number="1">Luck runs out.
Crawl from the wreckage one more time,
Horrific memory twists the mind,
Dark, rutted (rugged), cold and hard to turn,
Path of destruction, feel it burn.
Still life,
Incarnation,
Still life,
Infamy.
Hallucination,
Heresy,
Still you run,
What′s to come
What′s to be
</verse>
<chorus number="1">′Cause we′ll hunt you down without mercy,
Hunt you down all nightmare long,
Feel us breathe upon your face,
Feel our shift, every move we trace.
Hunt you down without mercy,
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah.
Luck runs...
And you crawl out again,
But your luck runs out.
</chorus>
<verse number="2">Luck runs out.
The light that is not light is here
To flush you out with your own fear,
You hide, you hide,
But will be found,
Release your grip without a sound,
Still life,
Immolation,
Still life,
Infamy.
Hallucination,
Heresy,
Still you run,
What′s to come
What′s to be
</verse>
<chorus number="2">′Cause we′ll hunt you down without mercy,
Hunt you down all nightmare long,
Feel us breathe upon your face,
Feel our shift, every move we trace.
Hunt you down without mercy,
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah.
Luck runs...
And you crawl out again,
But your luck runs out.
</chorus>
<verse number="3">Then you crawl back in,
Into your obsession,
Never to return,
This is your confession.
</verse>
<chorus number="3">Hunt you down without mercy,
Hunt you down all nightmare long.
Feel us breathe upon your face,
Feel our shift, every move we trace.
Hunt you down without mercy,
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah.
Luck runs...
And you crawl out again,
But your luck runs out.
</chorus>
