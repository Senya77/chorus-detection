<verse number="1">Do unto others as they′ve done to you
But what the hell is this world coming to
Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest
</verse>
<chorus number="1">Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
</chorus>
<verse number="2">We all shall die
Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon′s here, like said in the past
</verse>
<chorus number="2">Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
</chorus>
<verse number="3">Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath
</verse>
<chorus number="3">Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
Fight fire with fire
Fight
