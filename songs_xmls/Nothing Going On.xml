<verse number="1">I′ve been around the world I′ve got a hit in the charts
I′ve become quite famous But I ain′t got no heart
I′ve got expensive clothes and lots of money to waste
I′ve got the luxury lifestyle but I aint got no taste
</verse>
<chorus number="1">nothing going on nothing going on
I′ve got a whole lot of nothing
nothing going on
</chorus>
<verse number="2">I know all the right people, I′ve got the perfect smile
I′ve got the worlds best timing, but I ain′t got no style
I′ve got a great big mansion, I′ve got a beautiful wife
I′ve got a black rolls royce, but I′ve got no life
</verse>
<chorus number="2">nothing going on nothing going on
I′ve got a whole lot of nothing
nothing going on
</chorus>
<chorus number="3">nothing going on
Nothing going right, nothing going wrong
I′ve got a whole lot of nothing
nothing going on
</chorus>
<chorus number="4">nothing going on nothing going on
I′ve got a whole lot of nothing
nothing going on
</chorus>
<verse number="3">I′ve got a personal trainer, I ride a limousine
I′ve got a big bank account, but I ain′t got no dreams
I′ve got a private plane, the best of everything
I′ve got a lifestyle to live, but no message to sing
</verse>
<chorus number="5">nothing going on nothing going on
I′ve got a whole lot of nothing
nothing going on

<chorus number="6">nothing going on
Nothing going right, nothing going wrong
I′ve got a whole lot of nothing
nothing going on

<chorus number="7">nothing going on nothing going on
I′ve got a whole lot of nothing
nothing going on
nothing going on
nothing going on
