<verse number="1">Winter′s city-side
Crystal bits of snowflakes all around my head and in the wind
I had no illusions
That i′d ever find a glimpse of summer′s heat-waves in your eyes
You did what you did to me, now it′s history i see
Here′s my comeback on the road again
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight, it′s easy when you′re big in japan
</verse>
<chorus number="1">You′re big in japan
You′re big in japan
You′re big in japan
It′s when
You′re big in japan, then i′ll sleep by your side all through the night
Big in japan, it′s easy to be
</chorus>
<verse number="2">Neon on my skin
Passing silhouettes of strange illuminated mannequins
Shall i stay here at the zoo
Or shall i go and change my point of view for other ugly scenes
You did what you did to me, now it′s history i see
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight, it′s easy when you′re big in japan
</verse>
<chorus number="2">You′re big in japan
You′re big in japan
You′re big in japan
It′s when
You′re big in japan, then i′ll sleep by your side all through the night
Big in japan, it′s easy to be
</chorus>
<chorus number="3">Too late, too late
You′re big in japan
You′re big in japan
You′re big in japan
It′s when
You′re big in japan, then i′ll sleep by your side all through the night
Big in japan, it′s easy to be
You′re big in japan, then i′ll sleep by your side all through the night
Big in japan, it′s easy to be
</chorus>
<chorus number="4">You′re big in japan
You′re big in japan
You′re big in japan
It′s when
You′re big in japan
