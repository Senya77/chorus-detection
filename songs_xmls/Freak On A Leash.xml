<verse number="1">Something takes a part of me.
Something lost and never seen.
Everytime I start to believe,
Something’s raped and taken from me… from me.
</verse>
<verse number="2">Life’s got to always be messing with me.
(You wanna feel alive)
Can’t they chill and let me be free
(So do I)
Can’t I take away all this pain.
(You wanna feel alive)
I try to every night, all in vain… in vain.
</verse>
<chorus number="1">Sometimes I cannot take this place.
Sometimes it’s my life I can’t taste.
Sometimes I cannot feel my face.
You’ll never see me fall from grace
Something takes a part of me.
You and I were meant to be.
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me.
</chorus>
<verse number="3">Feeling like a freak on a leash.
(You wanna feel alive)
Feeling like I have no release.
(So do I)
How many times have I felt diseased
(You wanna feel alive)
Nothing in my life is free… is free
</verse>
<chorus number="2">Sometimes I cannot take this place.
Sometimes it’s my life I can’t taste.
Sometimes I cannot feel my face.
You’ll never see me fall from grace
Something takes a part of me.
You and I were meant to be.
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me.
</chorus>
<verse number="4">Boom na da mmm dum na ema
Da boom na da mmm dum na ema

<verse number="5">So… Fight! Something on the… Dum na ema
Fight… Some things they fight
So… Something on the… Dum na ema
Fight… Some things they fight
Fight… Something of the… Dum na ema
No… Some things they fight
Fight… Something of the… Dum na ema
Fight… Some things they fight
</verse>
<chorus number="3">Something takes a part of me.
You and I were meant to be.
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me.
Part of me…
Oh…
