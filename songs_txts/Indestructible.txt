Another mission
The powers have called me away,
Another time
To carry their colours again,
My motivation
An oath I′ve sworn to defend
To win the honour
Of coming back home again.
No explanation
Will matter after we begin,
I′m like the
Dark destroyer that′s buried in me
My true vocation,
You know my unfortunate friend,
You will discover
Why you′re unable to win.
I′ll have you know
That I′ve become…
Indestructible,
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side,
A terror to behold,
Annihilation will be unavoidable,
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent cannot be invincible,
Take a last look around while you′re alive,
I′m an indestructible master of war!
Another reason,
Another cause for me to fight,
Another fuse uncovered
Now, for me to light,
My dedication
To all that I′ve sworn to protect,
I carry out my orders
With not a regret,
A declaration
Embedded deep under my skin,
A permanent reminder
Of how we began,
No hesitation
When I am commanded to strike,
You need to know
That you′re in for the fight of your life.
You will be shown
How I′ve become....
Indestructible,
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side,
A terror to behold,
Annihilation will be unavoidable,
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent cannot be invincible,
Take a last look around while you′re alive,
I′m an indestructible master of war!
