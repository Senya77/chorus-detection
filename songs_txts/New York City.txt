I′m lost in a world of lights
Mezmerize my nights
The sky scrapes on building sites
I′m feeling so alive
Whatever′s clever
Whatever′s clever will have to wait
Thinking on the world at large
The city′s got it all
Culture clash and sidewalk trash
Don′t look down you might fall
And now we just feel like energy
New York City will never sleep
And now we just feel like synergy
New York City it′s a place to be
I′m gonna win
I′m gonna lose
I′m gonna chase it till the end
And if you′re walking in my shoes
You′re gonna make it or pretend
Whatever′s clever
Whatever′s clever will have to wait
And now we just feel like energy
New York City will never sleep
And now we just feel like synergy
New York City it′s the place to be
Yeah
It′s a place to be in
